# Flanker Test

## Introduction
Flankers tests are a set of response inhibition tests used to assess one’s ability to suppress inappropriate responses in a given context. In simple words, it is a set of tasks where a person is supposed to look for a particular target among various flanking stimuli (thus the name flankers test). It is used to assess/measure a person’s information processing and selective attention.

## We have used 3 different tests:

1. **Arrows**: In this test, the participants are shown series of images for each of which participant has to give the direction of the arrow in the center of the image by pressing appropriate buttons on the keyboard.

2. **Red arrow**: In this test, the participants are shown series of images for each of which participant has to give the direction of the arrow shown in red color by pressing appropriate buttons on the keyboard. The other arrows are shown by a neutral colour.

3. **Alphabet representative**: In this test, 4 letters: X,C,N,M are used and all of them are assigned a particular representative direction (left and right directions), Letter ‘X’ and ‘C’ belongs to the left direction and letter ‘N’ and ‘M’ belongs to the right direction (because of their relative position on the keyboard). They can also see a ‘+’ character sometimes which is a neutral stimuli. The participants are shown series of images in each of which they see a string of 5 letters. The participant has to look at the middle letter and accordingly press the character representative for the character.

This is final project for the course of **"Cognitive Psychology" at IIIT-Delhi**.
